SmartDictBuilder is a C++ application developed to construct a dictionary of unique patterns for system-on-chip (SoC) design using graph-based clique partitioning. By analyzing compatibility among test vectors, the program generates optimized dictionary entries that facilitate efficient SoC design processes.

Key features include:

Graph-Based Approach: Constructs a compatibility graph to identify and partition cliques.
Dynamic Input Handling: Supports varying dictionary sizes and test vector lengths, ensuring flexibility.
Error-Resilient Design: Robust validation for input files and command-line arguments.
Optimized Output: Produces merged patterns as dictionary entries with maximal compatibility.
Server Compatibility: Fully compliant with the UT Dallas departmental server requirements.
SmartDictBuilder is an innovative solution for enhancing design efficiency in embedded systems and hardware architecture research.
